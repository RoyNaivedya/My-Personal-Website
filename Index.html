        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I am Naivedya, a world class coder and game developer. I'm great at maths, science, english and coding. I am highly regarded all over the world as the best person to ever live. In my free time (which I don't get a lot of) I like to read books. One of my favourite book series is Harry potter, a wonderful series written by J.K Rowling. I study coding at whitehathat junior under the supreme guidence of Haleema ma'am . She teaches a lot of childeren but only one can be her favourite (Hint:It's me!). Anyway that's all for today. See y'all next time. Buh-bye.</p>
